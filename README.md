This repository contains the code for the paper "Hamiltonian-based Quantum Reinforcement Learning for Neural Combinatorial Optimization". 

To replicate the results from the publications, please refer to the config files in the `configs` folder and run them via the `main.py` file. 

To create the appropriate conda environment run (for more info refer to [conda cheat sheet](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/4.6.0/_downloads/52a95608c49671267e40c689e0bc00ca/conda-cheatsheet.pdf))

```
conda env create --file qrl.txt
```



In this repository additional implementations of e.g. Q-PPO as well as well as OpenAI gym wrappers can be found. 



If you have any questions regarding the code or the paper, feel free to reach out. We are happy to help!
